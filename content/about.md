I'm an Economics Master's graduate with a background in data analysis, econometrics, and international development. Experienced with SQL, Python, Tableau, and Stata, I specialize in turning complex data into actionable insights.

Iâ€™ve conducted economic research in academic and international settings (United Nations Millennium Fellowship), managed SQL databases for global trade analysis, and applied econometric models to real-world policy problems.

Actively seeking Data Analyst, Business Analyst, or Economic Research roles where I can leverage my skills to drive data-informed decisions.

home is the mouth of a shark
you only run for the border
